- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **State Management**: React Context/Hooks

### Storage & Media
- **MinIO**: Object storage for audio files and generated images
  - S3-compatible storage solution
  - Used for storing and serving media files
  - Configured with CORS for web access
- **MongoDB**: Document database for content
  - Stores books, chapters, pages, and summaries
  - Handles flexible document structures
  - Supports complex queries and relationships

### AI Services
- **Audio Service**: Python-based TTS implementation
- **Image Generation**: Integration with AI image generation APIs
- **Text Processing**: Natural Language Processing for summaries

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 21 or later
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Python 3.8+ (for audio service)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- MongoDB 6.0+
- MinIO Server

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend/CoreService
```

2. Build and run using Maven:
```bash
./mvnw clean install
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the Frontend directory:
```bash
cd Frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Audio Service Setup
1. Navigate to the audio-service directory:
```bash
cd audio-service
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the service:
```bash
python audio_service.py
```

### Database Setup
1. Start MongoDB and MinIO using Docker Compose:
```bash
cd backend
docker-compose up -d
```

## üîß Development

### Code Style
- Backend follows Java best practices and Spring Boot conventions
- Frontend uses ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Python code follows PEP 8 guidelines

### Testing
- Backend: JUnit tests for core functionality
- Frontend: React Testing Library for component testing
- Integration tests for API endpoints

## üì¶ Deployment

The application is containerized using Docker and can be deployed using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
